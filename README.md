# OVERVIEW

This post-installation script prepares an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) server for [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/) by updating and configuring the system, installing required dependencies, and setting up [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) for security and intrusion prevention. It is ideal for cheap deployments and tailored for solo developers seeking a simple, secure, and efficient setup.
